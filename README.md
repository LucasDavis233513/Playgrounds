# Playgrounds
## Concept
Testing / play grounds for me to play with idea’s and concepts. For example, playing with game mechanics (magic, sword fighting, etc), complex ideas (like using machine learning in some of the npc’s AI), testing 3D models that I made, playing with sound (tweening effects, etc), etc.
i.e. The playgrounds is a concept game to develop and test mechanics and complex ideas for other games..
